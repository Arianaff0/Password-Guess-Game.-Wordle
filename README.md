# Password-Guess-Game.-Wordle
This is a cybersecurity challenge, you're given six attempts to figure out a 5-character passcode(unfortunately it doesnt 
exit the code when you've guessed correct, or reached more than six attempts--have to figure that out later) 

Each guess provides information about how the characters in your guess relate to the mystery passcode. Each
character in your guess is tagged as either a correct character, a used character, or an unused character.
Assume all passcode is composed of 5-letters.

Letters are decorated/surrounded with either “-“, ”+”, or “!” which correspond to unused, used,
and correct. In a GUI-based system, unused characters might be displayed as grey(-), used are yellow(+),
and correct are green(!)
