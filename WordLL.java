/**
 * Basically WordLL has two instance variables, mysteryWord and history.
 * history is a linked list, and the datatype of that linked list is an
 * object of Word, which is another linked list. The history basically stores the
 * history of all the word guesses. WordLL has a mysteryWord, Word object, which
 * is a linked list of the letters of that mysteryWord.
 * history is null means that it is pointing to no nodes. In the tryWord method,
 * you call the labelWord method on the guess Word object. Then it compares the guess
 * and mysteryWord objects and updates the decorator symbols of guess. newNode is a new
 * LinearNode object that has guess as its element. newNode.setNext(history) sets history
 * as NewNode's next node. history = newNode is how you connect the nodes. In the toString
 * method, currentNode.getElement returns the Word element stored in the node. So the
 * toString method being called after is the toString in class Word.
